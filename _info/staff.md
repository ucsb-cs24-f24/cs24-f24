Hi everyone! My name is Nawel, I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the CS department. I graduated with an Engineering/Master’s degree from the National School of Computer Science in my hometown of Algiers - Algeria. I then moved to Japan to pursue my second Master’s at the University of Tokyo, before joining Hitachi, Ltd. where I worked on various research projects. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to know more about any of the above, and of course, about C++ development. I look forward to working with you all!
