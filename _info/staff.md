Hello everyone! My name is Sanjana Shankar and I am a 3rd year Computer Science major! This is my first time being a ULA for this course and I am looking forward to working with you all and helping you all learn about these fundamental computer science concepts that will be applied throughout your lives. Apart from coding, I enjoy singing and learning how to play my favorite songs on my acoustic guitar as well as dancing as I learned Indian classical dance for a majority of my life! This is my third quarter being a ULA at UCSB, so please feel free to approach me with any questions regarding student life, the computer science major and the classes offered, and quite literally anything as I enjoy getting to know you all!
